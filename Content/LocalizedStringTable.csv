Portbradden_Title,Portbradden Harbour
Portbradden_Body1,"Portbraddan Harbour was once a small fishing hamlet where salmon-fishing was practiced for a long time. The earliest record of the place is dated to 1822, found in the itinerary to the Giant’s Causeway (1st edition 1788), by Rev. William Hamilton who reported of Port-Bradan or ‘Salmon Harbour’. The place-name can be explained from port, meaning ‘harbour’, and bradán, an Irish word for ‘salmon’. [image 2]"

Portbradden_SalmonBody,"One can find many place-names connected with salmon-fishing throughout the island of Ireland. For example, the Salmon Leap at Coleraine, a weir only a little over ten miles to the south-east of Portbraddan on the river Bann (the first record of the place dates to 1610, from the Atlas of Great Britain by John Speed), but also the town of Leixlip in Co. Kildare. The latter comes from the Old Norse lax ‘salmon’ and hlaup ‘leap’, a direct Norse translation of the Irish léim an bhradáin ‘leap of the salmon’. [image 1] Fishing for salmon was a renowned activity of the Irish fishermen. In Irish folklore, and connected with the famous Finn mac Cool, the leader of the legendary Irish Fianna, whose personality is connected to the story of the Giant’s Causeway only a short trip from Portbraddan along the coast, who was responsible for catching ‘a salmon of knowledge’ (Ir. bradán feasa) at the river Boyne. As he roasted and tasted the fish, Finn acquired the power of knowledge. [image 1] Esteemed as the most valuable fish, it was prohibited to name the fish of salmon by its name, so Irish fishermen made up many nicknames to avoid this. “They used to talk about them as fish and the silvery fellows”, Bairbre Ní Fhloinn reports, also the lad (or, in Irish, an buachaill), an boyo, an boc ‘the buck’ (in Co. Galway), the gentleman (or, in Irish, an duine uasal) in Co. Kerry, cold iron or cold iron fellow in Co. Down.

They preferred not to call the fish by its name in other places too: on the Isle of Man, England and Scotland they fished called it the red fish, and sometimes the beast or the fool with the scales. In Norway, the fishermen used to call the salmon blank-kar ‘the bright fellow’, generalen ‘the general’ and kongen ‘the king’. In Scotland, the fishermen also called the salmon by a name like ‘Charlie’ or ‘Billie’. [image 1] The old fishermen used to rub some of the blood of the first salmon onto their shoes as soon as it came into the boat. They thought it was very lucky to do that. It was unlucky to bring boiled eggs on board if you are salmon-fishing. If the salmon-fishermen might meet a red-haired woman, a fox, or a hare, on his way to the harbour, they would likely to return home. The fishermen of Glenariffe, Co. Antrim, believed the salmon to have some supernatural qualities: “if they were ginnlin’ salmon (i.e. tickling the fish running your hand under the stone easily until you get hold of them), and the salmon squeals, they’ll leave him alone”.[image 1] On the north coast, there were stories told of salmon-fishing, and the fishermen believed that salmon had some connection to the fairies and the dead.

Here is a story we heard. “But one night, some years ago, there was a crew fishing for salmon a bit from this place, and when they took the salmon into the boat they heard the most dog-like crying they ever heard, in here, at this beach. And they got afraid, and after a while this crying changed to laughing. And they were listening all the time, and they thought eventually that it must be people who were drowned in the old days who were there. And they rowed home as quickly as they could, and it got rough and the night changed. And all the salmon they got that night, they were as black as the devil. And they were making out that they were all people who were drowned.”"
Portbradden_BoatTitle,Boat Info
Portbradden_BoatBody,"[image 1] There were special boats here, in Portbraddan, used for salmon-fishing. The North Coast salmon boats, known as cobles, were based on Aberdeen cobles from Scotland. The one you can see is a digital replica of the boat used by Bertie McKay, donated to National Museum of Northern Ireland in 1982. Built in 1930, double-ended for better control coming ashore with the falter floor for better carrying power, this boat is a combination of the typical double ended clinker built drontheim synonymous with the Antrim coast and the traditional Scotch salmon coble."
